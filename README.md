# filaments_quantification
This project includes segmenation, seperation, reconnection three steps as stated in the paper.
The proposed method aovid reconnecting filaments at intersection and thus acheives a better result than existing methods.

This repo is based on the following two papers:

* Densely Connected Stacked U-network for Filament Segmentation in Microscopy Images [link](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_eccv_2018_workshops/w33/html/Liu_Densely_Connected_Stacked_U-network_for_Filament_Segmentation_in_Microscopy_Images_ECCVW_2018_paper.html)
* Intersection to Overpass: Instance Segmentation on Filamentous Structures With an Orientation-Aware Neural Network and Terminus Pairing Algorithm [link](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/paper/BIC/Liu_Intersection_to_Overpass_Instance_Segmentation_on_Filamentous_Structures_With_an_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf)
